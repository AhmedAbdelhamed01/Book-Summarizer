PDF Summarizer
PDF Summarizer is a web application that allows users to upload PDF files and obtain a summarized version of the text content. The application leverages a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for high-quality text summarization.

Features
Upload PDF Files: Users can upload PDF files through a simple web interface.
Text Extraction: Extracts text content from PDF files.
Text Summarization: Summarizes the extracted text using a state-of-the-art NLP model.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-summarizer.git
cd pdf-summarizer
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Start the Flask application:

sh
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
Usage
Open the application in your web browser.
Upload a PDF file using the provided form.
The application will extract text from the PDF, summarize it, and display the summary on the web page.
Dependencies
Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
PyPDF2: A library capable of extracting document information and content from PDF files.
Requests: A simple and elegant HTTP library for Python.
Detailed Functionality
Text Extraction (extract_pdf.py)
preprocess_text(text): Preprocesses extracted text by removing special characters and extra whitespace.
extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path): Extracts text from a given PDF file and preprocesses it.
Model Interaction (model.py)
query(text): Sends a request to the Hugging Face model to get a summarized version of the input text.
allowed_file(filename): Checks if the uploaded file is a PDF.
Main Application (app.py)
index(): Renders the index page.
summarize(): Handles file upload, text extraction, summarization, and response generation.
